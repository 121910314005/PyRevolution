    "PyQt4 is a toolkit for creating GUI applications. It is a blending of Python programming language and the successful Qt library. Qt library is one of the most powerful GUI libraries.\n",

    "\n",
    "A GUI or Graphical User interface is a type of interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Well first of all, it makes it more convenient to use when you are dealing with people who cant code.. unless you want them to react to something like this..."
